# Support-Vector-Regression.
upport Vector Regression (SVR) in R
This script demonstrates how to build a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model in R to predict continuous outcomes. The SVR model is useful for capturing complex, non-linear relationships between variables by using kernel functions. The script includes data preparation, model training using the e1071 package, and visualization of the results to compare the SVR fit with actual data points.

Steps:

Load and prepare the dataset

Train the SVR model with the svm() function from the e1071 package

Visualize the model predictions against actual data

Make predictions on new data points
